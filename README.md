## WayPoints

If speeding is registered at a way point it is assumed that the violation started at the prior way point meaning that the speeding distance/duration is calculated with respect to the prevoius way point.

One could argue that the solution should make use of abstract interfaces, however, since I make no assumption that there will be further feature requests to the challenge I chose to keep things simple and not impose the solution with the extra complexity of an IoC container this would require.
